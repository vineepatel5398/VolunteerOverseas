                <p>Although our volunteers work in the developing world, we always ensure our host locations are safe. Each programme has been extensively researched and has passed our strict vetting process. Our UK team undergo an extensive routine when establishing our in-country infrastructures and we continue to monitor our safety procedures on a regular basis. Furthermore, we monitor the stability of our volunteer destinations on a daily basis. Through our constant contact with consulates and embassies and our reports from our overseas teams, we are able to ensure that our volunteers are never placed in unstable regions.</p>

                <p>The PMGY team have visited and participated in every programme we offer and verified them based on our own independent criteria. We carefully inspect every little detail of our set-up. From inspecting the living conditions, checking out the neighbourhoods you’ll be staying in, to tasting the food you’ll be eating – each and every programme we establish has gone through a lengthy and rigorous vetting process. Risk assessments have been written for all areas in which PMGY operate and our experienced local coordinators are always on-hand to manage any emergencies that may occur. Our UK team are always on the road reviewing our risk management procedures in the field and monitoring local conditions.</p>

                <p>In emergency situations we have the necessary protocols and equipment in place and we are able to evacuate our volunteers from potential dangers. Our local coordinators are trained to deal with emergency circumstances.</p>

                <p>When you join PMGY we will send you a Volunteer Handbook. This document addresses a range of issues such as health, safety, visa issues etc. Furthermore, our UK team are only ever a phone call away should you wish to discuss any aspect of your upcoming programme. When you arrive in-country, you’ll be given a comprehensive safety briefing during your orientation course by our local coordinators. We will go through everything from emergency procedures, how to use local transport and cultural differences. You’ll also be given the opportunity to purchase a local SIM card, something we strongly suggest, so you’re contactable at all times. We will provide you with a full list of the important contact numbers that you’ll need to know.</p>

                <p>All our local teams are experienced development professionals who have years of experience in hosting international volunteers. They are our representatives on the ground and will assist you 24/7 throughout your stay. Whether you need to call home, travel at the weekend or require urgent assistance – they are there to support you.</p> 

                <p>While we cannot guarantee your volunteer experience to be 100% trouble free we have taken all the necessary precautions to make sure each programme is as safe as possible.</p>

We aim to provide a structured experience and we feel participants are most comfortable when they arrive on the set start date and commence the programme itinerary right away.</p>

                <p>Late arrivals are problematic because participants will miss the initial orientation session. This is one of the most important parts of the whole programme and attendance is compulsory.</p>

Volunteers are usually assigned one project for the duration of their time in-country.</p>

                <p>You can choose to book your flights independently or we can help you in arranging them. Through our close partnerships within the travel industry we are able to offer flights at very competitive rates. PMGY has a wealth of experience in travelling to and from our host countries; we know the most affordable ways to travel and the best airlines to use.</p>

                <p>For peace of mind, PMGY holds an ATOL Licence (No. 11262) that allows us to offer flight-based packages that are financially protected by the Civil Aviation Authority in the unlikely event of our insolvency.</p>

                <p>If you’d like to receive a flight quote from PMGY, you can submit an online enquiry by visiting the specific web-page of the programme you’re interested in joining, or by calling our office or dropping us an email.</p>

                <p>When you apply for a PMGY programme we cannot guarantee your acceptance immediately. On receiving an application we have to liaise with our local team to ensure there is space available on the programme and to assess your suitability for the specific project.</p>

                <p>Therefore, we strongly recommend that you do not make any flight and/or travel arrangements until your programme has been confirmed by us in writing. Once your programme has been confirmed you’re then free to book your flights either with PMGY or a through third party travel agent.</p>

                <p>With PMGY the money our volunteers pay goes towards the structure you receive for your time with us overseas. The fundamentals of this structure include food, accommodation, airport pickups, around the clock support from our UK and in-country team, pre-departure training as well as the implementation and monitoring of the projects.</p>

                <p>We do our best to keep our programme costs as low and affordable as possible, without sacrificing on quality and safety. However with flights, travel insurance and spending money to factor into your overall budget, you may find you need a little bit of help with the finances. Therefore a large number of PMGY volunteers decide to fundraise for their trip.</p>

                <p>We recommend setting up an online fundraising page to allow friends and families to learn more about your trip and make donations. PMGY have partnered with the online crowd funding website GoGetFunding.</p>

                <p>This professional online fundraising service creates a personalised fundraising page for your PMGY trip, allowing you to set financial goals and get the message across about what you’re doing. You can also share your PMGY fundraising page across various social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to spread the word.</p>

All of our programmes have been designed so that you have weekends off. This gives you the opportunity to explore the local area or even travel further afield within your host country. Our local coordinators will provide you with all the travel tips you need to help you plan any independent adventures.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, you’re going to meet so many new people during your time with PMGY that you’ll definitely meet some travel buddies along the way!</p>

                <p>Before booking your flights we recommend that you look into travel opportunities within the relevant country either side of your volunteering placement. It is always great to spend some time travelling and seeing more of the country you wish to volunteer in. If you do plan to travel extensively please factor this into your flight itinerary, as we only encourage travel during weekends while you’re volunteering as you have made a commitment to the project.</p>

            <p>There are numerous ways you can keep in touch with home whilst you’re away. Virtually all accommodation types, apart from in our most rural locations, will have telephone access. We also advise you bring an unlocked mobile phone and buy a local SIM card. Some of our accommodation types offer Internet access so you can email, Skype or Facebook home freely. If this is not available at your accommodation, you can use an Internet cafe in town.</p>

            <p>Our local coordinators and UK team are also contactable 24/7. We will provide you with contact details of our UK and in-country emergency numbers for you or your parents to call in such an instance. If you have difficulty contacting home or your parents have difficulty contacting you, we are always available to pass on any messages on your behalf.</p>

            <p>And if you fancy contacting home the old fashioned way, you can always write a letter or postcard – however please remember that the postal service in the developing world is very slow so please allow plenty of time for your letter/postcard to reach home!</p>

            <p>We have a set emergency procedure in place so our local teams are ready to react in the unfortunate event of you becoming ill. We will immediately transport you to a medical facility so you can receive treatment. All of our in-country staff are experienced in hosting international volunteers and will always look to put volunteers in International Hospitals with English speaking medical staff. In the UK, we liaise daily with our local teams so that we can contact your family and friends to ensure everyone is fully aware of your situation. We can also relay any messages between you and your family if you’re unable to contact each other directly. This service is available 24/7, 365 days of the year.</p>

            <p>Although our local teams will assist you in getting to hospital and support you during the whole process, they are unable to pay for any medical fees. You must ensure you possess the appropriate travel insurance to cover relevant medical expenses.</p>

            <p>We offer our own travel insurance policy specially designed for PMGY volunteers.</p>

            <p>It is absolutely fine for you to make a donation to the project you’ll be working at. In many cases you’ll find that you can pick up most things you may wish to donate within the host country itself. Therefore, we recommend you buy any goods whilst you’re out there rather than purchasing in your own country. This not only provides much needed stimulation to the local economy and frees up space in your luggage but it also gives you the chance to see with your own eyes exactly what the placement needs and what you can give.</p>

            <p>We highly discourage participants to donate cash payments directly to their project. Ultimately we can never guarantee where these funds would end up.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions, please contact our team to discuss the options available to you.</p>
